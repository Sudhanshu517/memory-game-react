## Overview
This is a memory card game where players need to match pairs of cards with the same emoji. Players can flip over two cards at a time, and if they match, they stay revealed. If they don't match, they are flipped back. The game continues until all cards are matched.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the interactive game.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating smooth transitions (grid layout, card flip animations).
- **JavaScript**: Logic for managing card states, turns, and game progress.

## Features
- Responsive design with a 4x3 card grid for desktops and 3x3 for smaller screens.
- Animations when flipping cards.
- Turns counter that tracks the number of turns.
- Game over message with total turns once all cards are matched.
- Restart button to start a new game.

## How to Play
1. Click on any two cards to flip them.
2. If the two flipped cards match, they remain face up.
3. If they donâ€™t match, they flip back over after a brief moment.
4. Keep matching pairs until all cards are revealed.
5. The game ends when all cards are matched, and you can see how many turns it took to win.
